"""
A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.
"""

# RegEx Functions

"""
findall	Returns a list containing all matches
search	Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split	Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub	    Replaces one or many matches with a string
"""

# The findall() function returns a list containing all matches.

import re

txt = "We Love Python"
x = re.findall("on", txt)
print(x)  # ['on']

# The search() function searches the string for a match, and returns a Match object if there is a match.
# If there is more than one match, only the first occurrence of the match will be returned:

txt = "We Love Python"
x = re.search("o", txt)
x2 = re.search("Java", txt)

print("First Located in position:", x.start())  # First Located in position: 4
# print("First Located in position:", x2.start())  # First Located in position: None

# The split() Function

txt = "Python Java C++"
x = re.split("\s", txt)
print(x)  # ['Python', 'Java', 'C++']

# The sub() function replaces the matches with the text of your choice:

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", txt)
print(x)  # The9rain9in9Spain

"""
.span() returns a tuple containing the start-, and end positions of the match.
.string returns the string passed into the function
.group() returns the part of the string where there was a match
"""
# Search for an upper case "S" character in the beginning of a word, and print its position:
txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("Sp", txt)
print(x.span())
