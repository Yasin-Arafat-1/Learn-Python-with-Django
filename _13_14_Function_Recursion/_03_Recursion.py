The term Recursion can be defined as the process of defining something in terms of itself. In simple words,
it is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.

>> Advantages of using recursion

1. A complicated function can be split down into smaller sub-problems utilizing recursion.
2. Sequence creation is simpler through recursion than utilizing any nested iteration.
3. Recursive functions render the code look simple and effective.

>> Disadvantages of using recursion

1. A lot of memory and time is taken through recursive calls which makes it expensive for use.
2. Recursive functions are challenging to debug.
3. The reasoning behind recursion can sometimes be tough to think through.

# Head recursion Vs Tail recursion

# Tail recursions will not have any code statements after function calls
# and are generally at the end of the function declaration.

    if n == 0:
        return
    else:

# If a recursion has code statements to be executed after function call then it is a Head recursion.
def head(n, cnt):
    if n == 0:
        return

        cnt += 1
        head(n - 1, cnt)

    print(n)


print(head(10, 1))

# Which is better? [Head and Tail]

"""
Generally, tail recursions are always better. Even though they both have same time complexity 
and Auxiliary space, tail recursions takes an edge in terms of memory in function stack. 
Head recursions will wait in function stack memory until the post recursion code statements are executed 
which causes a latency in overall results, whereas tail recursions will be terminated in function 
stack over execution.
