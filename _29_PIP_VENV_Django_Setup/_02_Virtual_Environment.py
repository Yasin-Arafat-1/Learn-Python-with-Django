# Virtual Environments ("virtualenvs") keep your project dependencies separated. They help you avoid version conflicts
# between packages and different versions of the Python runtime.

"""
>> Why do we need a virtual environment?

Imagine a scenario where you are working on two web based python projects and one of them uses a Django 1.9 and the other uses Django 1.10 and so on.

In such situations virtual environment can be really useful to maintain dependencies of both the projects.

>> Installing virtualenv

pip install virtualenv

>> Test your installation

virtualenv --version

>> Using virtualenv

virtualenv my_name

>> Activate Virtual Environment
