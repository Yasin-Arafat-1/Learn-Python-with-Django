# 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗦𝗤𝗟?

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in relational database management systems for many years now. It was developed at IBM in the early 1970s. As relational databases are still very much popular, the need to use them is still present for any developer.

The SQL language has 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀, which are components of statements and queries, 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, that can produce scalar values or tables, 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic, and 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, which retrieve data based on criteria and some other elements.

So, the question is 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗦𝗤𝗟. Here are some (free) resources that I can recommend:

𝟭. 𝗦𝗤𝗟𝗕𝗼𝗹𝘁 - is a completely free fully interactive introductory course. All SQL basics are covered including writing queries, filtering, joins, and aggregations in addition to creating, updating, and deleting tables.

𝟮. 𝗦𝗤𝗟𝗭𝗼𝗼 - It provides both tutorials and exercises, and that’s why it is equally useful for someone just starting with SQL and programmers who know SQL but want some good practice to really master it.

𝟯. 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗧𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝘁 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗖𝗮𝗺𝗽 - This SQL course has got more than 7 million views and I think it's Youtube’s most popular free SQL course.

𝟰. 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝗦𝗤𝗟 - is actually a really interesting tool for collaborative SQL querying. It enables multiple users to share queries, store commonly used queries in a searchable library, and provide a visual interface for analysis.

𝟱. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗯𝘆 𝗔𝗹𝗮𝗻 𝗕𝗲𝗮𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘂 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸 - This book provides some helpful context regarding the language's history and current usage, offers an overview of query and table architecture, and covers some more complex SQL subjects than the courses mentioned above.

Full links are in the comments. Also, check the enclosed SQL mindmap that shows an overview of SQL language.
