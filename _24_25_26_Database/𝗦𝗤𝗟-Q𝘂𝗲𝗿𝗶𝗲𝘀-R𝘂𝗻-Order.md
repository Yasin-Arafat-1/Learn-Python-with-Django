# 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿

We utilize SQL queries to access a collection of records that are stored in our database tables. Clauses are the building blocks of SQL queries. To get the right outcomes, these clauses must be executed in a specific order. SQL query execution order is the name given to this sequence of operations.

𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿 refers to how the query clauses are evaluated in accordance with the requirements or how to optimize database search results. We use clauses in a specific order known as the SQL query execution order, similar to how we plan something step by step and arrive at the end result.
